#Push Notifications

You can schedule certain message types to be pushed to your users. For example, a user can be notified when their BuddycloudID is mentiond in a channel (an _@mention in Twitter), or channels they participate in receive new posts.

Push notifications can currently be sent through [GCM](http://developer.android.com/google/gcm/index.html) and email.

Push notifications are powered by the [Buddycloud Pusher](https://github.com/buddycloud/buddycloud-pusher) project. The _Pusher_ is designed to be easy to extend to cover new event types in channels and new push systems.
