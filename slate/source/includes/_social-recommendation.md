You can improve your users' onboarding experience by comparing existing social graphs (for example from Facebook or email address books) to match for friends already using Buddycloud.

The results of this query are usually displayed to the end user as a "People you may know" screen.

The friend finder can use arbitary identificaiton sources. Currently these are:
* email
* phone number
* Twitter ???@abmar - what???
* Facebook ???@abmar - what???

To create a hash:
1. `@abmar: please fill in`
2. ... 
3. ... 

###Privacy
The [friend finder](http://github.com/buddycloud/friend-finder) service matains the user's privacy by only ever uploading hashes of identifiers - never the users or their address friends' real email, phone number or other private information.

You should also request your users permission before uploading any identifiers.
