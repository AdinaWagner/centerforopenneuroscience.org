#Channels

Users subscribe to channels, which work in conjunction with nodes. Channels are comprised of nodes that share related content. Channels represent broader topics while nodes represent related subtopics. The broad topic (or channel) of dog ownership has the following related subtopics (or nodes): feeding schedule, exercise requirements, training methods, and so on.

Remember that a Channel is just a concept - there can only be a Channel if there's at least one Node.
