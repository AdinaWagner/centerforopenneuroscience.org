#Channels

Users subscribe to channels, which work in conjunction with nodes. Channels aggregate nodes that share related content. Channels represent broader topics while nodes represent related subtopics. The broad topic (or channel) of dog ownership has the following related subtopics (or nodes): feeding schedule, exercise requirements, training methods, and so on.

##Create Channel

```shell
curl https://demo.buddycloud.org/api/capulet@topics.buddycloud.org \
     -X POST \
     -u juliet@buddycloud.org:romeo-forever
```

```javascript
socket.send(
    'xmpp.buddycloud.create',
    {
        "node": "/user/balcony-speeches@topics.montague.lit/posts",
    },
    function(error, data) { console.log(error, data) }
)
```

Users can create any number of topic channels. An error is returned if there is an existing channel with the same `ChannelID`.

<aside>At sign-up, a personal channel is automatically created for each user. For example, `juliet@capulet.lit` signing up will trigger the server to automatically create a channel called `juliet@capulet.lit`. Remember, new topic channels are created in their own namespace (`channelID@topics.example.com`).</aside>

Metadata allows you to describe the channel, set defaults and even add a location to the channel so that it will show up in nearby queries.

Channel metadata is always visible for both public and private channels.
