#Conventions to keep us consistient

Denote variables with `{variable name}`

not `:variable name`

eg: `GET https://demo.buddycloud.org/api/{channelID}/media/{Mediaid}`

##Channel types:

channel access: `public` and `private`
(not open, or closed)

##Naming variables:

Referring to a channel (the JID-like part) we call it the `channelID` (not `channel-name`)

##Examples

Use examples from romeo and juliet. (not alice and bob)
