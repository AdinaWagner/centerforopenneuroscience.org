#Search

You can search for authors, metadata, channels, and channel content.

There are two search services on Buddycloud that are tuned for different needs,

- *Local search:* finds content on your own Buddycloud domain.
- *Buddycloud-wide search:* finds channels, posts and metadata from public channels using the [Buddycloud crawler](https://github.com/buddycloud/channel-directory).

Search type      | Local search | Buddycloud-wide search

Channel content  | public and private channels | public channels
Post author      | yes          | no
Channel metadata | yes          | yes
