      <p>
        Buddycloud channels attempt to reuse as much of XMPP's native federation and XEP-0060 pub-sub design. Buddycloud channels are not a pub-sub server and the business-logic behind the pub-sub node behavior and posting behavior mean that a machine-to-machine designed pub-sub server will not provide a great "social" experience for users. The channel services are handled by XEP-0114 components.
