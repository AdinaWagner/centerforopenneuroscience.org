  <h2>Open Source</h2>
  <p>Extend Buddycloud to your exact needs using the flexibility of Buddycloud's fully open source code. 
  All <a
     href="http://buddycloud.com/software">Buddycloud software</a>, is developed in a transparent way 
     and released under the Apache 2.0 licence. Adaptable to your exact needs and 100% lock-in free.
    </p>
  <p>
    Buddycloud believes in building an open communication ecosystem and is working closely with teams at the W3C,
    Mozilla Foundation, and XMPP Standards Foundation to champion the open, silo-free internet.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Federated</h2>
  <p>Anyone can run their own Buddycloud server and they automatically interconnect. Buddycloud is a federated 
  meaning that your users can connect, share and message with users on other Buddycloud-enabled sites. Without gatekeepers.
  Without limitations.
   </p>
  
  <h2>Extensible</h2>
  <p>Design your Buddycloud stack with just the components you need. Then, add more components to customise 
  your users' experience. Inventing new content types is as simple as dropping in a new plugin. Whatever you design, 
  Buddycloud makes sure the right content reliably gets to the right people.
   </p>
  
  <h2>Community</h2>
  <p>Build real time communication into your product with advice, help and code from the community that cares about 
  shipping great messaging products.  You are supported with real time chat, mailing lists and support contracts.
   </p>
  
  <h2>Support</h2>
  <p>Your project is in safe hands with 24/7 support from the core Buddycloud team. Buddycloud offers a range of 
  support contracts, consulting, licensing, testing and hosting options. All designed to help you ship on time, 
  run reliably, and smoothly scale-up.
   </p>
  
  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>Benefit from Buddycloud's strong foundation of peer-reviewed client libraries, strong crypto, and a transparent 
  development process. Backdoor free and secure by design. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Your users stay private with easy-to-understand privacy controls so they know what is shared and with whom.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Scalable</h2>
  <p>When your app takes off, your Buddycloud backend smoothly scales up. Each Buddycloud component is designed to be
  run in parallel and without a single point of failure. Whether it's traffic spikes or rapid application growth, 
  self hosted or the hosted option, you ramp-up smoothly. 
    </p>
  <p>For world-wide real time traffic, Buddycloud offers deep hooks into <a
     href="https://fanout.io/">Fanout's Real time CDN</a>, so that your only scaling problems will be your lack of ambition.
    </p>
  <p>
  
  <h2>Saves time</h2>
  <p>Save time with ready-made code that you can drop into your app. You can focus on your core app, without worrying about 
  small details like inter-device message synchronisation. Buddycloud's libraries for reliable messaging and a backend that 
  takes care of the heavy lifting keep you shipping code, not fixing issues.
   </p>
   
  <h2>Private and public cloud</h2>
  <p>Hosting on-cloud or on-premises? Some data can't live in the cloud. Your privacy and regulatory requirements are covered:
  Buddycloud is the only in-app messaging solution that can also run behind your firewall on your own private infrastructure. 
  Same code, same reliability, same support, but with flexible deployment options.
