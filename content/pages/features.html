  <p>Extend Buddycloud to your exact needs using the flexibility of Buddycloud's fully open source code. 
  All <a
     href="http://buddycloud.com/software">Buddycloud software</a>, is developed in a transparent way 
     and released under the Apache 2.0 licence. Adaptable to your exact needs and 100% lock-in free.
    </p>
  <p>
    Buddycloud believes in building an open communication ecosystem and is working closely with teams at the W3C,
    Mozilla Foundation, and XMPP Standards Foundation to champion the open, silo-free internet.

  <p>Anyone can run their own Buddycloud server and they automatically interconnect. Buddycloud is a federated 
  meaning that your users can connect, share and message with users on other Buddycloud-enabled sites. Without gatekeepers.

  Buddycloud makes sure the right content reliably gets to the right people.
   </p>

    </figure>
  <p>When your app takes off, your Buddycloud backend smoothly scales up. Each Buddycloud component is designed to be
  run in parallel and without a single point of failure. Whether it's traffic spikes or rapid application growth, 
  self hosted or the hosted option, you ramp-up smoothly. 
    </p>
  <p>For world-wide real time traffic, Buddycloud offers deep hooks into <a
     href="https://fanout.io/">Fanout's Real time CDN</a>, so that your only scaling problems will be your lack of ambition.
    </p>
  
  <h2>Saves Time</h2>
    <figure>
      <img src="/theme/img/diagrams/saves-time.png" alt="saves-time-diagram" class="pull-left" style="padding-right: 20px;" />
    </figure>
  <p>Save time with ready-made code that you can drop into your app. You can focus on your core app, without worrying about 
  small details like inter-device message synchronisation. Buddycloud's libraries for reliable messaging and a backend that 
  takes care of the heavy lifting keep you shipping code, not fixing issues.
   </p>

  <p>Hosting on-cloud or on-premises? Some data can't live in the cloud. Your privacy and regulatory requirements are covered:
  Buddycloud is the only in-app messaging solution that can also run behind your firewall on your own private infrastructure. 
  Same code, same reliability, same support, but with flexible deployment options.
