               <p class="lead">“We create the tools and services that enable developers to build secure communication products”.</p>
                <p>Buddycloud started with the idea of building a location based social network. The real magic happened when
                we added communication between users. Conversation flowed and the app came alive. It was then that we realised
                we wanted to build something more than a one-off application: we could build the communication systems that 
                help other developers bring community into their application. We could build a system that, like email, 
                interconnected communities. And we adopted a radically different development model: open source and open 
                standards is helping enterprise customers and small development projects add messaging and community to their
                apps.</p>
