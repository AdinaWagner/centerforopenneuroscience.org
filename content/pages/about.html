      <h2>The Team</h2>
      <dl class="dl-horizontal">
        <dt>Simon Tennant</dt>
        <dd>
          Simon grew up in South Africa and moved to the UK to study computer science at Warwick University. 
          His first venture: A company providing internet infrastructure for banks like UBS, Deutsche Bank in London. 
          Then, to gain first-hand experience of working for fast growing companies, Simon moved to Silicon Valley and 
          worked for Winamp/Spinner/AOL-music and a small Linux-based startup that raised $90M. 
          <p>Simon sits on XMPP Standards Foundation board, runs marathons and climbs mountains.</p>
          </dd>
        <dt>Abmar Barros</dt>
        <dd>
          Buddycloud Architect: Abmar applies his <a href="http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=nl8THIwAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">research</a>
          into large scale distributed design to Buddycloud's codebase. Previously he developed grid computing systems. 
          <p>Today he helps design and develop Buddycloud's server stack. He's also a semi-famous guitar player.</p>
          </dd>  
        <dt>Guilherme Santos</dt>
        <dd>
          Guilherme is amazing to work with - he's a perfectionist which means that when Buddycloud ships code, 
          it'll run perfectly. Guilherme comes to Buddycloud after finishing his scholarship at UW-Madison. 
          <p>Today Guilherme focus on the onboarding, documentation, testing, testing and more testing. 
          He loves watching TV shows and is always eager to learning more.</p>
          </dd>
        <dt>Mizar Fernandez</dt>
        <dd>
          Mizar studied Marketing, then discovered her real passion from a degree in Design Thinking.  Now she's applying
          Design Thinking's human-centered problem solving to how we build products at Buddycloud and tell our unique story.
          <p>In her spare time, she draws, gets lost in piles of books and travels around with post-its, 
          colored pens and a notebook on her pocket.</p>
