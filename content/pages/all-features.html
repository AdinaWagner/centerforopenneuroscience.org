	<p class="lead">Imagine what you can build with the Buddycloud ecosystem.</p>
	<h2>Chat, Channels, Video</h2>
	<p>Add file sharing and soon WebRTC calling) between users. The Buddycloud
		stack takes care of sharing, data synchronisation between users and image
		previews.</p>
	</p>
	<div class="bs-example">
		<p>To add fileshareing, simply call the upload API and, automatically, the
			binary object is shared with the right people.</p>
	</div>
	<h2>No heavy lifting required</h2>
	<p>Develop your app more quickly by using simple abstractions for common
		tasks. Buddycloud does all the heavy lifting for you: simple and easy to and
		make common tasks as easy as possible to integrate.</p>
	</p>
	<div class="bs-example">
		<p>Reduce app startup time by using Buddycloud's one-shot synchronisation
			call. It automatically works out what new information needs to be pushed to
			the mobile client and your users benefit from a fast time to glass.</p>
	</div>
	<h2>Mobile friendly</h2>
	<p>Now you can develop messaging that plays nicely with your users' mobile
		battery and data plan. When you integrate Buddycloud you benefit from a
		battery-friendly push notification service and pre-processing and sorting of
		messages on the server so that your user's batteries last longer and you can
		do less integration work.</p>
	<div class="bs-example">
		<p>Your app can configure the type of push notifications that should wake
			it up. Never poll for new messages again.</p>
	</div>
	<h2>Distributed design</h2>
	<p>Plug into a network of existing Buddycloud-enabled sites and users.
		Buddycloud's distributed design makes sure the right data is synchronised
		between users and sites.</p>
	<div class="bs-example">
		<p>Your users can connect and share with other sites also running
			Buddycloud. For example, a team collaborates and shares documents with a
			supplier on a remote Buddycloud site. Buddycloud ensures the confidential
			information stays behind your firewall.</p>
	</div>
	<h2>Scalable</h2>
	<p>Scale up with ease when your application gets popular.</p>
	</p>
	<div class="bs-example">
		<p>Scaling the the Buddycloud backend to to meet user growth is as simple
			as spinning up new server instances. Also, adding Realtime CDNs like Fanout
			is as simple as editing a config file.</p>
	</div>
	<h2>Open Source</h2>
	<p>
		Use the flexibility of Buddycloud's fully open source code to extend and
		customise freely. <strong>All</strong> Buddycloud software is released under
		the Apache 2.0 licence.
	</p>
	<h2>Open protocols</h2>
	<p>Building on open protocols lets you choose from among competing
		Buddycloud server and client implementations. Buddycloud works closely with
		the W3C, Mozilla Foundation, and XMPP Standards group to build the strong
		foundation for an open communication ecosystem.</p>
	<div class="bs-example">
		<p>Your project needs a new type of message: Buddycloud uses
			ActivityStrea.ms for post types and the ATOM syndication format so you can
			simply extend the code and use existing libraries.</p>
	</p>
	</div>
	<h2>Designed to be Secure</h2>
	<p>Build your app on the strong foundation of auditable client libraries,
		strong client to server crypto and verifiable server code. Secure by design.</p>
	<div class="bs-example">
		<p>Secure communication needs open, inspectable code. Benefit from a
			community that cares about getting security right (Buddycloud is used by
			security sensitive agencies). No backdoors, just strong security by design.</p>
		</p>
	</div>
	</p>

		you ramp your new Buddycloud site and keep it running reliably.</p>

	<h2>Designed to be modular</h2>
	<p>Design your Buddycloud stack with just the modules you need to run.
	<div class="bs-example">
		<p>A mobile app built on built on Buddycloud would need only the
			Buddycloud and Push notification Servers. Later on you support users'
			uploading avatars, and simply add the media server.</p>
	</div>
	<h2>Self-install or Hosted</h2>
	<p>Buddycloud comes in two compatible flavours: fully hosted and an
		install-it-yourself set of packages and instructions. Both editions use
		exactly the same code so that you have the flexibility to migrate your data
		and users between platforms by just changing the API url.</p>
