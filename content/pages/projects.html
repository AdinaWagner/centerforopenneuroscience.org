	  <a href="http://neuro.debian.net">NeuroDebian</a> is a turnkey
	  research software platform for all aspects of the
	  neuroscientific research process. It takes the ideas of the
	  software hosting portals such
	  as <a href="http://nitrc.org">NITRC</a> on maximizing research
	  transparency and methods sharing, one step further, by providing
	  a comprehensive suite of readily usable and fully integrated
	  software with a robust testing and deployment
	  infrastructure. Consequently, it improves interoperability among
	  the tools and frees researchers from the burden of tedious
	  installation or upgrade procedures. That, in turn, positively
	  affects their availability for actual research activities, as
	  well as their motivation to test new analysis tools and stay
	  connected with the latest methodological developments in the
	  field.

	  <a href="http://www.pymvpa.org">PyMVPA</a> is a Python-based
	  framework for neural decoding using multivariate pattern
	  analysis.  It affords both volume- and surface-based analyses
	  using a wide variety of supervised and unsupervised machine
	  learning methods, representational similarity analyses,
	  searchlight analyses, hyperalignment of representational spaces,
	  and model-based decoding and encoding.  The software also can be
	  used for neural data other than fMRI, including analysis of MEG
	  and EEG data through spatio-temporo-frequency band searchlights
	  and cross-modal EEG to fMRI trans-fusion.  It also has been used
	  for analyses on data unrelated to neuroscience, demonstrating
	  its general utility.  PyMVPA also serves as a repository for
	  sample data sets (e.g., Haxby et al. 2001) that has found wide
	  applicability for education, development of new algorithms, or
	  new analyses and independent research reports.

	  <a href="http://datalad.org">DataLad</a> is ongoing work funded
	  by NSF and German BMBF, to adapt the model of open-source
	  software (OSS) distributions to address the technical
	  limitations of today's data-sharing and develop all components
	  of a "data distribution". The key concepts are: 1) Leverage -
	  but do not replace - independent, existing, and future data
	  hosting solutions to form a federated platform for
	  data-sharing. 2) Employ software for data tracking and
	  deployment logistics specialized for large data
	  (<a class="reference external" href="http://git-annex.branchable.com">git-annex</a>) built
	  atop <a class="reference external" href="http://git-scm.com">Git</a>, the most capable distributed
	  version control system (dVCS) available today, to enable
	  efficient data access at any level of granularity (from single
	  files to entire collections of datasets). DataLad will provide
	  access to data available from various sources (e.g. lab or
	  consortium web-sites such as <a class="reference external"
	  href="http://humanconnectome.org">humanconnectome.org</a>;
	  data sharing portals such as <a class="reference external" href="http://openfmri.org">openfmri.org</a>
	  and <a class="reference external" href="http://crcns.org">crcns.org</a>) through a single
	  interface. It will enable students and scientists to operate on data
	  using familiar concepts, such as files and directories, while
	  transparently managing data access and authorization with underlying
	  hosting providers.

	<p>
	  <a href="https://github.com/duecredit/duecredit">DueCredit</a>
	  provides solution for the problem of inadequate citation and
	  referencing of scientific software and methods.  It provides a
	  simple framework (at the moment for Python only) to embed
	  publication or other references in the original code so they are
	  automatically collected and reported to the user at the
	  necessary level of reference detail, i.e. only references for
	  actually used functionality will be presented back if software
	  provides multiple citeable implementations.
	</p>
	<p>
	  As a side-effect, we hope that DueCredit also will reduce demand
	  in "prima-ballerina" projects, will encourage contributions to
	  existing open-source codebases, and as a result would solidify
	  scientific software ecosystem.

	  obtain elsewhere (e.g. on Travis-CI) -- various releases of
	  different operational systems (OS X, Windows, GNU/Linux Debian),
	  and even different architectures (e.g., PowerPC and SPARC).
	  Such rich coverage provides a valuable resource to the
