		The simplest way to describe Buddycloud is that you
		<code>GET</code>
		and
		<code>PUT</code>
		and
		<code>DELETE</code>
		and
		<code>UPDATE</code>
		content. These changes are automatically pushed to and shared with users on
		other sites running Buddycloud.
	</p>
	<blockquote>What could this content be?</blockquote>
	<p>This content is ATOM formatted posts, it's chat messages, it's any kind
		of file, likes, anything that helps communication and if it's not there,
		adding new content handlers is easy. Buddycloud has a complete set of calls
		that are accessible through three different APIs.</p>

	<h2>APIs</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Rest based API Buddycloud JS XMPP-FTW in production: stanza.io
			plug-in.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		All the <a href="/software#APIs">APIs</a> let you shove data into and pull
		data out of Buddycloud, synchronise clients with Buddycloud in an easy to
		understand way.
	</p>
	<h2>Buddycloud Channels</h2>
	<blockquote>Where is the API sending the DATA?</blockquote>
	<p>The data is going to different services. The most common one is the
		Buddycloud Channel server. To describe that we need to explain what a channel
		is. A channel is much like your Facebook feed or Twitter stream. You post
		content about what you are doing. Or status updates, or your Geolocation
		client posts latitude and longitude updates, it could be where you post your
		public key. Basically it's a way to push data to people that are interested in
		it and have them comment on it.</p>
	<p>You could also use a channel to programmatically share states between
		applications. For example your game could synchronise state between clients
		and players by posting to an application specific channel.</p>
	<h2>Buddycloud services</h2>
	<p>The Buddycloud server is the most common service in Buddycloud. But
		there are other services too. For example:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><em>the media server</em>, lets you upload media and share it with
			the followers of a channel or the whole wide world.</li>
		<li>The <em>push notification service</em> tells your followers, via
			mobile notifications and/or email about new content.
		</li>
		<li>There's a service that helps you connect with friends from other
			social networks called the <em>friend finder</em> service.
		</li>
		<li>There's a <em>content recommendations</em> engine that uses scalable
			machine learning to suggest similar content ("if you liked this content,
			perhaps you would also like ... If you like these channels, perhaps you would
			like these similar channels).
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>And a growing range of new services.</p>

	<h2>Distributed design</h2>
	<blockquote>How do all these services intercommunicate?</blockquote>
	<p>The magic about Buddycloud: it's completely distributed. For you this
		means that you can connect to, find, share and exchange updates with other
		Buddycloud users on your own Buddycloud server, or other sites also running
		Buddycloud.</p>

	</figure>
	<h2>Network transparent</h2>
	<p>
		Imagine the paradigm where Gmail users can only email Gmail users, Yahoo mail
		users can only email Yahoo users. Hotmail only Hotmail users. You expect to be
		able to email users on other sites. And yet this is how existing social
		networks [don't] inter-operate. Buddycloud blows this notion apart by
		introducing complete network transparency. Users on any Buddycloud site can
		contact users on any other site. <em>This is revolutionary!</em>
	</p>

	</figure>
	<h2>Synchronising</h2>
	<p>All this network transparency means that it's now possible to build
		social services where one organisation's users can connect share and update
		information with other organisations'.</p>
	<p>The Buddycloud service takes care of this magically behind the scenes:
		making sure that all the right content is in the right people's channels on
		the right domains, with the right permissions, in realtime.</p>

	</figure>
	<h2>Publish subscribe</h2>
	<blockquote>So what is a channel really?</blockquote>
	<p>A channel is a collection of publish-subscribe nodes. Each channel has a
		set of followers, who receive updates when new posts are created. For example,
		when you change your status node to "I'm happy", all your followers are pushed
		an update if they are online.</p>
	<figure>
		<img class="center-block" src="/theme/img/diagrams/channels comprise application nodes.png"
			alt="Buddycloud channels are built up from application nodes" />
	</figure>
	<h2>Content types</h2>
	<p>And this information can really be any type of information that you can
		define: For example Developers use Buddycloud to publish activity streams
		(similar to Twitter or Facebook), documents, public keys (to be able to
		exchange encrypted messages), votes, likes and incident reports.</p>
