        <h2>What is Buddycloud?</h2>
          <p>The Buddycloud stack helps developers add secure communication into their apps. This in-app communication builds 
          community, which then builds a great product experience for the end user. Buddycloud supports developers with reliable 
          tools and knowledgeable `direct-from-the-developer`support.</p>
        <h2>How does Buddycloud work?</h2>
          <p>Buddycloud's messaging code handles app authentication, security, cross-device synchronization, offline message
          management, and more.</p>
          <p>Developers add Buddycloud's SDK to their Mobile or Web-apps. This code then communicates with the Buddycloud server
          to synchronise messages, status-updates, pictures, videos, +1s, and any other message type you can invent.</p>
          <p>The Buddycloud service lives in a datacenter and takes care of storing messages and sending real time updates to 
          mobile and web apps as well as talking to other Buddycloud servers.</p>
        <h2>What are the supported platforms?</h2>
          <p>Buddycloud has native support for <a href="https://github.com/buddycloud/buddycloud-android">Android</a> and
          <a href="https://github.com/buddycloud/buddycloud-server-java">web/Javascript platforms.</a> 
          The backend code runs on any unix-like system. Buddycloud uses Postgres for persistent data.</p>
        <h2>What distinguishes Buddycloud from other companies providing messaging software?</h2>
          <p>Buddycloud is the only in-app messaging system that you can also run on-premesis.</p>
          <p>Buddycloud believes in an open and free internet and works closely with causes and the standards community to 
          defend our internet freedoms.</p>
        <h2>Designed for developers or companies?</h2>
          <p>Buddycloud's tools and services are aimed at developers, as well as, companies. Developers build their products 
          and can host on Buddycloud's infrastructure. Companies receive commercial support, security updates and custom 
          fixes.</p>
        <h2>What can I build with Buddycloud?</h2>
          <p>Some apps that have been built include a console-based text messaging, end-to-end secure messaging, a location 
          sharing platform and a social network.</p>
        <h2>Is Buddycloud free to use?</h2>
          <p>Free community support, free open source code, built on free and open protocols, free to download and run your
          own Buddycloud site. This all means you stay free from being locked-in. And, if you need hosting, a free pricing 
          option will get you up and running.</p>
        <h2>How can I contribute to the open source project?</h2>
          <p>The Buddycloud community contribute fixes to the open source code and help design future messaging products.</p>
          <p>The best place to start is introducing yourself on buddycloud-dev. We love pull requests: each project gets 
          tagged with "Help Wanted" (for example: <a href="https://github.com/buddycloud/buddycloud-server-java/labels/help%20wanted">
          buddycloud-server</a>).</p>
        <h2>Buddycloud is Federated. What does that mean?</h2>
          <p>A federated service means that your users can share messages and updates with users on any other Buddycloud site. 
          This is similar to how a user on gmail.com can send emails to their friend on Yahoo.com: messages flow seamlessly 
          between sites. And like email, it's nice when you can connect with users on remote sites: your Buddycloud site 
          becomes part of something much-much bigger.</p>
        <h2>What makes Buddycloud secure?</h2>
          <p>Secure systems are designed using a layered approach: like an onion, each layer protects inner layers. Buddycloud
          takes the same approach with each layer of Buddycloud's design:</p>
          <p>Unique hosting options: Medical and financial organisations (and the growing indie-hosting community) are 
          supported with an <a href="https://hosting.buddycloud.com/login">on-premesis hosting</a> option. Buddycloud is the
          only in-app messaging system runnable from behind the firewall. This unique approach helps organisations meet
          stringent audit and data care requirements. And helps keep the internet as an end-to-end system.</p>
          <p>End stay secure and avoid leaking data with simple privacy settings. And can optionally benefit from Buddycloud's
          support for end-to-end secure messaging.</p>
          <p>All the Buddycloud code is developed in an open and transparent manner making it much more difficult to hide
          exploitable backdoors in the code.</p>
          <p>The Buddycloud service is designed to run as modular components with defined edges. Users' data is 
          compartmentalised and only available to the parts of the system that need it. This prevents data leaking to 
          insecure modules.</p>
          <p>Most of all we stand on the shoulders of the crypto giants using field-hardend crypto code and best practices
          for securely transporting users' information.</p>
        <h2>What privacy controls does the user have?</h2>
          <p>Users should always know what information is shared and with whom. We've designed Buddycloud to avoid privacy
          confusion and developed three ways to share:</p>
          <p>A selected few trusted users: a private channel, for example - <a href="mailto:surprise-party@my-domain.com"> 
          surprise-party@my-domain.com.</a></p>
          <p>Just people on the local domain: a local channel: for example <a href="mailto:all-hands@company.com"> 
          all-hands@company.com</a></p>
          <p>Open to the world: an open channel: for example <a href="mailto:my-fans@ladygaga.com">my-fans@ladygaga.com</a></p>
        <h2>What's a username looking like in Buddycloud?</h2>
          <p>Just like email: Buddycloud usernames describe the user and the site they are from - for example: 
          <a href="mailto:username@example.com">juliet@capulet.com</a> (users can follow juliets social feed, message her and
          get her pictures from the capulet.com server).</p>
        <h2>How do you ensure high availability?</h2>
          <p>We understand the trust you are placing in Buddycloud to run your messaging stack: to support you, we've 
          assembled a team with a strong background in building highly reliable systems for Investment banks and core 
          infrastructure at AOL.</p>
        <h2>Can I customize it?</h2>
          <p>Adding new system components and by inventing new content types mean you can extend Buddycloud to very specific
          needs. For example, perhaps your application needs to share "Tasks" with team members. You can define a new content
          type plugin that will validate new tasks. Buddycloud comes with ready made components that handle things like push
          notifications, media storage, content search. To add new functionality, you simply add a new component to the mix.</p>
        <h2>What about scaling?</h2>
          <p>The founding team have worked on massively scaled systems and understand the challenges of designing systems for
          rapid growth. User growth is supported by horizontally scaling components. Additionally 
          <a href="https://github.com/buddycloud/buddycloud-http-api">Buddycloud's API</a> includes a plugin for Fanout's
          realtime CDN to help you globally distribute your traffic.</p>
        <h2>How do I get started?</h2>
          <p>Build a quick <a href="https://demo.buddycloud.org/">demo app.</a> If you still have difficulties or questions
          about the process, please let us know and we will guide you along the process.</p>
        <h2>How long does it take to get it running?</h2>
          <p>21 minutes and 22 seconds.</p>
