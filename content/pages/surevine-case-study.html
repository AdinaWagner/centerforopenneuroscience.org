					<h2>What does Surevine do?</h2>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“We believe in open source: A central principle of Surevine’s approach is that our solutions should avoid

					<p>Surevine delivers solutions based on secure collaboration technology, securing the best features of the social
					web, including social networking, instant messaging, and document management to build resilient, distributed smart
					networks of connected people. Our customers have the most demanding security requirements, and our systems are 
					accredited to handle their most sensitive information.</p>

					<h2>Surevine &amp; Buddycloud</h2>
					<p>Surevine have been innovating and developing on the Buddycloud stack, and have made significant contributions
					back to the project. The Buddycloud core has since been updated to reflect the  security requirements that their
					customers required, for the benefit of the wider community of users.</p>
					<p>The Surevine engineer responsible for this is Lloyd Watkin. Here's what he had to say.</p>
					<h3>Who are you?</h3>
					<p>Hi, I’m Lloyd Watkin, I work at Surevine as a Software Engineer.</p>
					<p><img alt="surevine-lloyd-working" src="/theme/img/case-studies/lloyd-watkin.png" class="pull-right" style="padding-left: 20px;" /></p>
					<h3>What was your background in Buddycloud before starting?</h3>
					<p>None at all, in all honesty. When I started with Surevine our CTO sat me down in front of Buddycloud asked me
					to learn about it and start hacking on a Java port of the existing server.</p>
					<h3>So you hacked on Buddycloud?</h3>
					<p>Yes, contributions from Surevine to the Buddycloud project range from work on the web client, HTTP API server,
					node.js server, notification system, media server, and documentation. Our biggest contribution however, is the 
					creation of a java-based version of the main server component.</p>
					<p>We also run our own federating Buddycloud site which the Surevine team uses for internal communication.</p>
					<h3>After working with Buddycloud, how's it different?</h3>
					<p>For me, it's really important to have a choice of provider and the flexibility to modify software. Buddycloud
					is a decentralised system; it’s not controlled by any one company / person / setup. Should one provider shut down
					or change their terms and conditions, I'm free to move my data to a new provider. The flexibility means I'll never
					have a  "I hate the new facebook UI" moment: I can make the changes I want without falling foul of arbitrary API
					restrictions.</p>
					<h3>When you aren't hacking on Buddycloud, what do you do?</h3>
					<p>I created and run an open source corkboard service called <a href="https://pinitto.me/" target="_blank">
					Pinitto.me</a> and the <a href="https://xmpp-ftw.jit.su/" target="_blank">XMPP-FTW project</a>; a bunch of 
					<a href="https://github.com/github/github-services" target="_blank">Github Services</a> that do neat things 
					on <a href="https://github.com/github/github-services/blob/master/docs/xmpp_muc" target="_blank">XMPP</a> and 
					<a href="https://github.com/github/github-services/blob/master/docs/buddycloud" target="_blank">Buddycloud</a> 
					when you commit code. I’m also involved with <a href="https://github.com/lloydwatkin/massah" target="_blank">Massah</a>,
					a nodejs automated browser testing library, and I promote open standards as a member of XMPP Standards Foundation
					and help organise a UK based XMPP meetup.</p>
					<h3>XMPP-ftw? What kind of problems does that solve?</h3>
					<p>XMPP-FTW helps Javascript developers build real-time messaging.</p>
					<p>Put simply, web developers don't like working with XML. XMPP-FTW solves this by translating to/from JSON on the
					server-side (where it can be done quickly). It exposes as much of XMPP as possible (i.e. it doesn't dumb things down)
					so its not a high level library; also, because it handles the connection to the XMPP server, developers just need to
					install an XMPP server and not worry about setting up other things like BOSH or websocket plugins.</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“Buddycloud solves a large number of problems for a large number of developers. If you need communications, 
						be it person to person, m2m, or a mix with realtime updates (as well as "after the fact") data gathering, then 
						Buddycloud is an interesting technology to look at.”</p> <small>Lloyd, Software Engineer at Surevine.</small>
