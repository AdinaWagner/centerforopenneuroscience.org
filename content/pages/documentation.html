		<h2>Hands On</h2>
		<p>Build a quick application using Buddycloud.
			<a class="btn" href="/get-started">Get Started</a>
		</p>
		<p>Or, check out the demo <a href="https://github.com/buddycloud/buddycloud-android">mobile app</a> or the demo <a href="https://github.com/buddycloud/webclient">web app</a> to see how Buddycloud works.</p>
	</div>

		<h2>How Buddycloud Works</h2>
		<p>Three components that work together: Open SDK, open protocol and open-source server.</p>
		<figure>
			<img class="center-block" src="/theme/img/diagrams/how-buddycloud-works.png" alt="How Buddycloud works" />
		</figure>
		<p>You add a small SDK to your mobile or web app; your users communicate.</p>
		<p>Web applications then communicate via a websocket with the Buddycloud Server. Mobile applications use the REST API (or XMPP).</p>
		<p>You can think of the Buddycloud server as a very sociable publish-subscribe server. Users messages are fanned out to their followers. Both on the local Buddycloud site and remote buddycloud sites (remember Buddycloud federates?).</p>

		</figure>
		<h3>Federation</h3>
		<p>Like Facebook has a wall, Twitter has a Feed, Buddycloud has channels. User's follow channels that can be another user (eg juliet@capulet.lit follows romeo@montague.lit) or topics (juliet@caputlet.lit follows fan-club@verona-fc.lit).</p>
		<p>Your users can follow channels and chat with users on local and remote Buddycloud sites.</p>

		</figure>
		<h2>Roles</h2>
<figure>
  <img class="center-block" src="/theme/img/diagrams/how-buddycloud-works-roles.png" alt="Buddycloud Roles" />
</figure>
		<p>Enable your users' conversation and disable spam. Your application can create users with different roles. Each channel can have an owner, moderator, Follower+post, Follower, Banned. The specifics of each role are defined in the Buddycloud-Protocol.</p>
		
		
		<h2>Channel Nodes</h2>

		<figure>
			<img class="center-block" src="/theme/img/diagrams/how-buddycloud-works-nodes.png" alt="Buddycloud Nodes" />
		</figure>
		
		<p>For maximum extensibility each Buddycloud channel is broken down furher into nodes. To keep your application data consistent, the each post to the Buddycloud server is validated by a content type plugin. For example the posts node MUST be activity-stream compatible. You can define your own content type - for example a x-application-myapp could validate that each new entry MUST be a valid Bitcoin address.</p>

		<h2>Channel Metadata</h2>

		<figure>
			<img class="center-block" src="/theme/img/diagrams/how-buddycloud-works-metadata.png" alt="Buddycloud Nodes" />
		</figure>
		
		<p>The channel juliet@capulet.lit can have a title "Juliet's channel", a description "Musings on life in Verona" and other metadat and privacy information. The full specification is contained in the <a href="http://xmpp.org/extensions/inbox/buddycloud-channels.html">Buddycloud protocol</a> document.</p>

		<h2>Helper services</h2>
		<figure>
			<img class="right-block" src="" alt="Helper Services" />
		</figure>
		<p>Buddycloud comes equipped with a number of helper services.</p>
		<p>You can easily extend your application logic by plugging in new helper services. They drop in as independent processes and can be programmed in your language of choice.</p>
		<h3>Friend-Finder</h3>
		<p>Friendly onboarding - The Friend-Finder connects your users to their existing friends inside Buddycloud using hashed identifiers. Your user uploads sha256(email:friend@gmail.com), sha(twitter:@benvolio) or sha(phone:+15551212) and the Friend-Finder returns the Buddycloud username associated with the hash. Quick, private, and friendly.</p>
		<h3>Taste-Engine</h3>
		<p>Buddycloud's Taste-Engine helps your users find similar users. If a user follows juliet@capulet.lit and nurse@capulet.lit perhaps they should also follow tybalt@caputlet.lit. The taste engine is powered by and continuously updated Apache-mahout taste-graph to always give your users great recommendations for new content.</p>
		<h3>Media-Server</h3>
		<p>Now your users can share files, pictures and really large video files with other users. The Media-Server is tightly integrated into the Buddycloud channels permissions structure to give your users seamless file sharing without needing to worry about permissions. The Media-Server also generates beautiful previews, scaled and cached on the fly to the exact size of your application screen.</p>
		<h3>Pusher</h3>
		<p>Push-to-pull: wake up your app with the Buddycloud-Pusher. The "Pusher" connects to GCM, APN, email and any other service you can adapt to use it and alerts your users to events that are happening: "Juliet liked Romeo's picture", "benvolio@montague.lit followed romeo@montague.lit".</p>
