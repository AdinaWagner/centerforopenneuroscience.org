	<h2>Distributed design</h2>
	<p>Your Buddycloud application plugs into a network of servers also running
		the Buddycloud stack. Amount of work to enable this: zero.</p>
	</p>
	<div class="bs-example">
		<p>Your users connect and share with other sites also running Buddycloud.
			For example a team collaborates and shares documents with a supplier on a
			remote Buddycloud site. Buddycloud ensures the confidential information stays
			behind your firewall.</p>
	</div>
	<h2>Scalable</h2>
	<p>Scale up with ease when your application gets popular.</p>
	</p>
	<div class="bs-example">
		<p>Rapid user growth means you need to quickly scale the Buddycloud
			backend as simply as spinning up new instances. Adding Realtime CDNs like
			Fanout is as simple ad editing a config file.</p>
	</div>
	<h2>More than just chat or text</h2>
	<p>Effortlessly add file sharing and soon WebRTC calling between users. The
		Buddycloud stack takes care of sharing, data synchronisation between users and
		image previews.</p>
	</p>
	<div class="bs-example">
		<p>Your app lets users attach content to their chats. All you need to do
			is use the upload API and the blob is automatically shared with the right
			people.</p>
	</div>
	<h2>No heavy lifting required (Buddycloud does the heavy lifting for your)</h2>
	<p>Developer quicker by using abstractions for common tasks. Buddycloud has
		tried to make common tasks as easy as possible to integrate.</p>
	</p>
	<div class="bs-example">
		<p>Your mobile app should start quickly so Buddycloud helps you by giving
			you just one sync call that automatically works out what new information
			needs to be pushed to the mobile client.</p>
	</div>
	<h2>Mobile friendly (say no to poll dancing)</h2>
	<p>Now you can develop messaging that respects your users' mobile battery
		and data plan. When you integrate buddycloud you benefit from a
		battery-friendly push notification service and pre-processing and sorting of
		messages on the server so that our user's batteries last longer and you can do
		less integration work.</p>
	</p>
	<div class="bs-example">
		<p>Your app can configure the type of push notifications that should wake
			it up. Never poll for new messages again.</p>
	</div>
	<h2>Open Source</h2>
	<p>Enjoy the freedom to extend the open source code when you need to. ALL
		code is released under the liberal Apache 2.0 licence.
	<h2>Open protocols</h2>
	<p>Building on open protocols lets you chose from competing Buddycloud
		server and client implementations. Buddycloud works closely with the W3C,
		Mozilla Foundation, and XMPP Standards Foundation to build the strong
		foundation for an open communication ecosystem.</p>
	<div class="bs-example">
		<p>Your project needs a new type of message: Buddycloud uses
			ActivityStrea.ms for post types and and the ATOM syndication format so you
			can simply extend the code and use existing libraries.</p>
		</p>
	</div>
	<h2>Secure by design</h2>
	<p>Build your app on the strong foundation of auditable client libraries,
		strong client to server crypto and verifiable server code.</p>
	<div class="bs-example">
		<p>Secure communication needs open, inspectable code. You benefit from a
			community that cares about getting secuirty right (Buddycloud is used by
			security sensitive agencies). No backdoors, just strong security by design.</p>
		</p>
	</div>
	</p>
	<h2>Run it yourself or have Buddycloud host it for you.</h2>
	<p>Buddycloud comes in two compatible flavours: fully hosted and an
		install-it-yourself set of packages and instructions. Both editions use
		exactly the same code so that you have the flexibility to migrate your data
		and users between platforms by just changing the API url.</p>
	<h2>Enterpise Support</h2>
	<p>The Buddycloud Enterprise Edition is integrated, tested, and includes
		patches, updates, SLA-based support, multi-year maintenance policies.</p>
	<p>Get in touch to find our more which edition is best for your needs.</p>
	<h2>Community Support</h2>
	<p>The Buddycloud community edition is open source, free to download and
		run on your site. It aims to provide the best both worlds: rapid updates and
		fixes with long-term stability, supportability, and maintainability.</p>
	<h2>Designed to be modular</h2>
	<p>Design your Buddycloud stack with just the modules you need to run.
	<div class="bs-example">
		<p>A mobile app built on built on Buddycloud would just need the
			Buddycloud and Push notification Servers. Then, to support user's uploading avatars,
			simply add the media server.</p>
	</div>
	<p>Imagine what you can build with the Buddycloud ecosystem.</p>
