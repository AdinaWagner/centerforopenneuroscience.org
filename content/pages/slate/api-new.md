#Introduction 

Buddycloud has APIs optimised for both mobile and for web applications. The Buddycloud mobile API is REST based. The web API is designed for Javascript and node-based applications.

To make Buddycloud as accessible as possible, all these API calls should work against the test instance running on buddycloud.org. Consider buddycloud.org a good reference implementation. Of course you are welcome to download the mobile or web API source code and run your own API.

##Time Format
All dates are in [ISO-8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format (example: "2012-08-21T22:31:20+0000"). In [strftime](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007908799/xsh/strftime.html) format, `*%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ*`

##Encoding
Each string passed to and from the buddycloud API must be UTF-8 encoded. (In the case of JSON set `Content-Type` to `application/json; charset=utf-8`)

#Pagination

All Buddycloud API resources have support for handling large results. Results are paginated. 
    
## Query Parameters

Parameter | Reqired/Optional | Description
--------- | ---------------- | -----------
max       | optional         | The maximum number of returned entries
before    |                  | Get posts before this timestamp
first     |                  | ??? is this a date and what format???
last      |                  | ??? is this a date and what format???
after     |                  | Return only entries older than the entry with the specified ID.
index     |                  | The element's (for example, a post) position in the result set

```shell
curl something.... 
"rsm" : { 
"count" : "2",
"index" : "0"
    }
```

```json
[
  {
        count: 99
        first: "item-123",
        last: "item-173"
    }
]
```

#API discovery
When `user@example.com` starts a Buddycloud-enabled app, the app must discover the API for `example.com`. Clients query for the `TXT` record of `_buddycloud-api._tcp.buddycloud.org`.

Post-it note: Your home Buddycloud server will then pass messages to followers on remote buddycloud server. Consider buddycloud.org a testing server for trying out requests.

```shell
# to resolve the API endpoint for buddycloud.org we use:
dig txt +short _buddycloud-api._tcp.buddycloud.org 
"v=1.0" "host=demo.buddycloud.org" "protocol=https" "path=/api" "port=443"
```

> This test tells us that client calls should be made against `https://buddycloud.example.com:443/api`

```javascript
socket.send(
    'xmpp.buddycloud.discover',
    { /* "server": "channels.buddycloud.org" */ },
    function(error, data) { console.log(error, data) }
)
```

> If a server is discovered the `data` will contain the channel server host. If no server is found, `error` will be populated.

#Users

##Create User

```shell
curl -i https://demo.buddycloud.com/api/account \
     -d '{ "username": "alice@buddycloud.org", \
           "password": "tell-no-one", \
           "email": "alice@buddycloud.org" \
         }'
```
> The above command returns JSON structured like this:

```json
[
  {
  ???
  },
  {
  ???
  }
]
```

##Delete User

<aside class="warning">Removing a user will delete the account. But not their channels. If it's important, delete their channels first.</aside>

##Change Password

#Realtime Events

something about sending presence to go online and start getting events

#Channels
Following a channel grants one access to that channels current [and future] nodes. The following default nodes are created. Additional nodes can be created by the channel owner.

Each user has a channel automatically created for them on sign-up that that matches their ID. For example `user@example.com` will have a channel created called `user@example.com`


##Create Channel
##Update Metadata
##Delete Channel
##Default Nodes

node            | Description | Example
--------------- | ----------- | ----------

geoloc-current  | Where they are               |

# Introduction

Welcome to the Kittn API! You can use our API to access Kittn API endpoints, which can get information on various cats, kittens, and breeds in our database.

We have language bindings in Shell, Ruby, and Python! You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.

This example API documentation page was created with [Slate](http://github.com/tripit/slate). Feel free to edit it and use it as a base for your own API's documentation.

# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```ruby
require 'kittn'

api = Kittn::APIClient.authorize!('meowmeowmeow')
```

```python
import 'kittn'

api = Kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow')
```

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "api_endpoint_here"
  -H "Authorization: meowmeowmeow"
```

> Make sure to replace `meowmeowmeow` with your API key.

Kittn uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can register a new Kittn API key at our [developer portal](http://example.com/developers).

Kittn expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: meowmeowmeow`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace `meowmeowmeow` with your personal API key.
</aside>

# Kittens

## Get All Kittens

```ruby
require 'kittn'

api = Kittn::APIClient.authorize!('meowmeowmeow')

api.kittens.get()
```

```shell
curl "http://example.com/api/kittens"
  -H "Authorization: meowmeowmeow"
```

> The above command returns JSON structured like this:

```json

    "id": 1,
    "name": "Fluffums",
    "breed": "calico",
