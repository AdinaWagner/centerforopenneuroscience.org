    Simon is unkillable in the <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/badeconomy.html">grandest sense</a>. He'll never let an idea die and has chaperoned Buddycloud through a half-dozen iterations since 2006. He's also a party animal, if the party is five thousand feet above sea level in a mountain hut.

    I don't know much about you stefan but i'm sure simon does so he should write his thoughts in here. and try and make the vertical length of the paragraph match up with the other paras. Ben admits that Stefan is probably a better Javascript developer than himself.

  <h3>Ben Nolan</h3>

  <p>
    Ben writes the web client and does our web design. He is totally in love with HTML5 and Javascript and believes that the client is the future.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    He has founded two startups, Zoomin and Glare Technologies and has worked with Buddycloud since 2008. Ben respects the punk ethos and we suspect he'd still skate to work even if he was balling.
