title: getting started with buddycloud
---

<h2>hosted or self-install</h2>
<p>
  buddycloud is a distributed service. Any domain can run a buddycloud server, and each buddycloud server will find, connect and synchronise data with other buddycloud sites.

  You can use a hosted version of buddycloud, or <a href="/install">install you own buddycloud site</a>. We recommend you start with the hosted version and see if buddycloud is right for you.
