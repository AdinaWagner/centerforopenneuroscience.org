    <h2>How buddycloud works</h2>
    <div class="main feature open image-left">
      <h3>Celebrating open protocols, open source, open ecosystems</h3>
      <i class="icon-open"></i>
      <p>We have rethought the architecture of social networks. Instead of traditional <a href="http://facebook.com">centralised</a> <a href="http://twitter.com">models</a> our design principle is to distribute control. Each site runs its own buddycloud server. Users connect and share information with other users on other sites.</p>
      <p>This radical design gives you strong privacy controls and gives you access to friends anywhere on the buddycloud universe. [and connect to other social networks].</p>
      <p>buddycloud is working with <a href="http://w3c.org">W3C</a>, the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/foundation/">Mozilla Foundation</a>, and <a href="http://xmpp.org/">XSF</a> to work together to lay the solid foundation for an open social ecosystem.</p>
      <p>Soon all products will integrate a social layer. The buddycloud software is a simple to integrate. Our open protocols ensure no single company controls your system.</p>
      <p>We make available our reference server as well as a web-client and android-client so your project can quickly benefit from buddycloud's social tools. All buddycloud software is open source and available under the Apache 2.0 license.</p>
      <p>We make use of existing open standards like <a href="http://activitystrea.ms">ActivityStrea.ms</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_%28standard%29">ATOM syndication format</a>. You benefit from existing libraries and supporting the open web buys you enough karma to afford a stable of unicorns! #GreatToBeOpen</p>

    <div class="main feature fork image-right">
      <h3>Fork the buddycloud software and kickstart your project</h3>
      <i class="icon-fork"></i>
      <ul>
        <li>Avoid re-implementing a social stack with every single new project: buddycloud ships with code examples get you started quickly.</li>
        <li>The server is written in <a href="http://nodejs.org">node.js</a>, the webclient is built with <a href="http://backbonejs.org">Backbone</a>, and and we have developed an <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.buddycloud">Android client</a>.</li>
        <li>All code is designed so that you can quickly and easily adapt it for your specific goals.</li>
        <li>Licensed under a do-what-you-want-with-it license.</li>
      </ul>

    <div class="main feature distributed image-left">
      <h3>Distributed by design</h3>
      <i class="icon-distributed"></i>

      <p>How would it be if Gmail couldn't send email to a Hotmail account? Social Networks are still like this.</p>
      <p>buddycloud has designed a new way to share: each buddycloud instance can connect and share information with other buddycloud websites. Or you can run it behind your firewall for just your team alone.</p>
      <p>Our tools also designed to link users with legacy networks like Facebook and Twitter.</p>
      <p>When you start your own buddycloud site, your small instance joins a much larger ecosystem of other sites already running buddycloud and users will never have to register again and again.</p>

    <div class="main feature media image-left">
      <h3>Easy share files, films, photos.</h3>
      <i class="icon-media"></i>

      <p>Media can be shared within just one channel or with the entire world. On one buddycloud site or between buddycloud sites.</p>
      <p>The buddycloud media server is a bit like DropBox but enhanced to work on every site: now users and developers can manage their own media sharing. Files, films, photos are seamlessly synchronised. It just works. <a href="https://github.com/buddycloud/buddycloud-media-server" target="_blank">Learn more</a></p>
