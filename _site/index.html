  An open social network
</h2>

<p class="intro">
  buddycloud is built for people who care about their privacy.

  We are building the future of social networks. A future founded on openness. A future built using open standards.

  We are making the future happen now, by building a massively scaled and fully distributed social network.

  <h3>Distributed Freedom</h3>

  <p>
    Your quiet conversations remain your secret. Anyone can run their own buddycloud server which makes buddycloud very difficult to block. buddycloud is your tool to say what you want to say. You are in control of your channel and your privacy.

  <h3>The Right Thing</h3>

  <p>
    buddycloud is about getting it right. It’s not about tailoring a platform to advertisers and you won’t find any sponsored tweets. buddycloud is working to bring privacy, openness and secure communication to everyone in a way that just works.  </p>
